🌍 I’m excited to share Safety Watch: Beacon Alerts, a web platform our team built at the Code White hackathon to support civilians in conflict zones. It provides real-time alerts, safe zone information, and resources to minimize the impact of global conflicts on vulnerable communities.

💻 On the front end, we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive, responsive experience. We added animations (using AOS, plus custom counters and accordions) to make the interface engaging and informative. On the back end, PHP and MySQL power our data handling: all crisis data, user reports, donations, and subscriptions are securely stored and retrieved in a MySQL database.

🔒 Our platform includes secure authentication (using PHP sessions) so that only authorized users can submit reports or manage data. People can submit distress messages and missing person reports through forms, and all information is logged in the database for quick response. We also integrated a donation portal and an email subscription form, connecting willing donors to relief efforts.

🤝 The mission is human-centered: we designed Safety Watch to put people first. By combining technology with compassion, we hope to empower communities with timely information and support. This project reminds me why technology can make a difference in people’s lives.

Thank you for reading!
